# Reminder

- What we will talk about next usually can take 1-2 whole sessions for a master program in order to understand the technical details. Today the main purpose is to go through the tasks that R are capable of solving. 

--

- R studio is very user-friendly. As explained before, whenever you have problem with a function, just type "?" + `function()`. For example:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?summary
?lm
?data.frame

```
--->R Studio

- If possible, please follow alone with your computer. It helps you to learn R faster! Welcome to ask question at any time.

---

# Data

The example data we use are `paquid_cog.csv` and `paquid_cov.csv`.

--

## Install and load package

We will mainly use the following two packages:
- `tidyverse`: A powerful package for data wrangling, which I will show later.
- `Hmisc`: We need this package for adding label to data.frame().
- However, please note that packages are not mandatory for solving the following tasks!

* To install package, you can use `install.package()` function.


```{r install package, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("Hmisc")
```

* we can load the package by using `library()` function.

```{r import package, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(Hmisc)
```


```{r, include=FALSE}
library(DT)
```

---

## Import data

There are many different functions to read data, depending on the file's type. Since we have csv file, we can use `read.csv()` to read the data.

```{r}
cog_df <- read.csv(file = "data/paquid_cog.csv")
cov_df <- read.csv(file = "data/paquid_cov.csv")
# Use ?read.csv() to check what other arguments you can put in
```

---

# Explore data

Usually the first thing we need to do is to check if the data are **correctly imported**.

- Looking at the `Data` panel
![](pic/Data_panel.png)

--

- Use `str()` function to check if the column types are as expected.

```{r}
# check data's type
str(cog_df)
```

---

# Explore data

```{r}
# check data's type
str(cov_df)
```


--

- Here we can see the data types are as expected.
- However, there is a non-sense column "X", we need to get rid of it. The easiest way to use `select()` function from `tidyverse` package.

```{r}
# get rid of the first column 'X'
cog_df <- cog_df %>% select(-X) 
cov_df <- cov_df %>% select(-X)
```

---

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# get rid of the first column 'X'
cog_df <- cog_df %>% select(-X) 
cov_df <- cov_df %>% select(-X)
```

Beautiful syntax with pipeline, just like playing LEGO. ---> R studio 

![](pic/legos.jpg)



---

# Explore data

- Use `head()` function to check the first few rows of dataframe

```{r}
head(cov_df)
```

- Use `class()` function to check the type of cov_df: Is it a matrix, or data.frame, or list, or tibble? 

```{r}
class(cov_df)
```

--

Personally I would love to convert `data.frame` to `tibble` for data wrangling.  --> R studio...

---

# Explore data

We may also interested in checking the descriptive statistics: `summary()`

```{r}
# descriptive statistics
summary(cog_df)
```


---

#	Generate and label variables

1.	Generate a variable “fu”, which means follow-up time and equals to age - age_init

* Let's first review cov_df:

```{r}
head(cov_df)
```

* How do we extract a specific column? By Google you can find many ways, one of them is to use `$` sign. "[1:10]" means take the elements one to ten.
```{r}
cov_df$age_init[1:10]
```

---
#	Generate and label variables

1.	Generate a variable “fu”, which means follow-up time and equals to age - age_init

* Now we are ready to generate the new variable:

```{r}
fu <- cov_df$age - cov_df$age_init 
# if you want to add the new variable to dataframe
cov_df$fu <- fu
head(cov_df)
```

---

#	Generate and label variables
2.Generate a variable “dem_young”, which means age of dementia onset (variable “agedem”) ≤70 years old (use the the if/else statement).

--

```{r ,highlight.output=c(3,2)}
dem_young <- ifelse(cog_df$agedem <= 70, yes = 1, no = 0) 
# put dem_young to cog_df
cog_df$dem_young <- dem_young
head(cog_df)
```

???

The "<=" sign is wrong

---

#	Generate and label variables
3.**Rename** variable “CEP” as “education” and change the variable class to **factor**. **Label** the variable values as 0=“Below primary school”, 1=“Primary school and above”.

--

* We can rename a specific column "CEP" as follows:

```{r}
colnames(cov_df)[colnames(cov_df) == "CEP"] <- "education"
head(cov_df)
```


--

* Wait, what is going on here? ---> R studio

---

#	Generate and label variables
3.**Rename** variable “CEP” as “education” and change the variable class to **factor**. **Label** the variable values as 0=“Below primary school”, 1=“Primary school and above”.

* To label the variable we need to use the fore-mentioned `Hmisc` package. 

--

Actually this is also new for me...

--


```{r}
label(cov_df[["education"]]) <- "0='Below primary school', 1='Primary school and above'"
```

--

And then you can use View panel to check the label in the dataset.---> R Studio.

--

Or use the `factor` function:

```{r}
cov_label = factor(x = cov_df[["education"]],levels = c(0,1),labels = c('Below primary school','Primary school and above'))
head(cov_label)
```

---

#	Merge and reshape data sets

4.**Merge** datasets “paquid_cog” and “paquid_cov” to a data frame named “paquid”.

--

* With `join_` function: There are 4 common types of joins.


![](pic/join_tabel.png)


---

#	Merge and reshape data sets

4.**Merge** datasets “paquid_cog” and “paquid_cov” to a data frame named “paquid”.

```{r}
paquid <- full_join(x = cog_df, y = cov_df, by = c("ID", "wave", "age"))
head(paquid)
```


---

#	Merge and reshape data sets

* With `merge` function: In merge function, it finds columns with the same name by default. Therefore we only need to specify x and y data sets. You can recheck this by reading `?merge`. 

```{r}
paquid2 <- merge(x = cog_df, y = cov_df)
head(paquid2,n = 3)
```

???

You can specify all.x = TRUE to keep all the rows in X or all.y = TRUE to keep data frame Y...


--

* This result is difficult to compare with paquid. We can reorder paquid2 so that it has the same column/row order as paquid.

---

```{r}
paquid2 <- paquid2[order(paquid2$ID), names(paquid)]
head(paquid2,n = 3)
head(paquid,n = 3)

```


---

# Merge and reshape data sets

5.Reshape the “paquid” data to **wide** format.

* Reshaping a data set is pretty tricky, usually I need to test out several times before I can arrive the final interested format.

![](pic/spread_table.png)

---

# Merge and reshape data sets

* Points to consider:

1. What is the variable that measures the time span?
2. What variables we would like to spread? Is it only one column to spread, or multiple?
3. What variables are unchanged?

---

# Merge and reshape data sets

* Time span: column `wave` represents the time span.

```{r}
summary.factor(paquid$wave)
```

--

* Columns to change
  * If only spread `MMSE` column

```{r}
paquid_wide = spread(data = paquid, value = "MMSE", key = "wave", sep = "MMSE")
```

---

# Merge and reshape data sets

```{r}
paquid_wide
```

---

* Columns to change
  * If only spread `MMSE` column.
  * If we want to change all the columns varying at waves. (`reshape()` function)

```{r}
# timevar: the variable in long format that differentiates multiple records from the same group or individual.
# idvar: Columns that will not be affected, stay the same
unchange_column <- c("ID", "age_init", "education", "male", "agedem", "dem","dem_young")
wide_paquid <- reshape(data = paquid, timevar = "wave", idvar = unchange_column, direction = "wide", sep = "_")
wide_paquid

```


---

# Merge and reshape data sets

* The changing mentioned above is reversable, check:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
?gather
?reshape
```

---

# Row-wise calculation

6.Generate a variable named “MMSE_M”, which is the number of missing values across variables “MMSE_1”, “MMSE_2”, …, “MMSE_9” per individual. Label the variable as “the number of missing values in MMSE”.

```{r}
# convert dataframe to tibble for faster data cleaning
wide_paquid <- as_tibble(wide_paquid)
paquid_MMSE <- wide_paquid %>% select(c("ID", contains("MMSE")))
paquid_MMSE

```

---

# Row-wise calculation

* Use `rowSums` combined with `is.na`.

```{r}
MMSE_M <- rowSums(is.na(paquid_MMSE))
length(MMSE_M)
MMSE_M[1:10]
# merge the vector to the tibble
paquid_MMSE$MMSE = MMSE_M
```




---
# Row-wise calculation

7.View variables that contain “MMSE”.

* Use the `selection` from `tidyverse` package. 

```{r, results='hide'}
wide_paquid %>% 
  select(contains("MMSE")) 
```


---

# Row-wise calculation

8.Generate variables “MEM_1”, “MEM_2”, …, “MEM_9” which equals the mean of “BVRT” and “IST” at each time point.

--

* The original wide format data set has too many columns... Let's start with one babystep first:

```{r}
# this tibble is the "ingredient"
wide_paquid %>% select(contains(c("ID","BVRT","IST")))
```


---

# Row-wise calculation
* What should MEM_1 look like?

$$ MEM_1 = (BVRT_1+IST_1)/2 $$

--

```{r, highlight.output=c(4)}
wide_paquid %>%
  select(contains(c("ID", "BVRT_1", "IST_1"))) %>%
  rowwise("ID") %>% # indicate the row index
  mutate(MEM_1 = mean(c(BVRT_1, IST_1))) %>% # mutate: create new column
  ungroup() # need to ungroup for rowwise calculation
```

---

# Row-wise calculation

* Can we do the above process directly on the whole wide dataframe? --- Yes!

```{r}
wide_paquid  %>% 
  rowwise("ID") %>% 
  mutate(MEM_1 = mean(c(BVRT_1,IST_1))) %>% 
  ungroup() 

```

---

# Row-wise calculation

* We can do the same procedure for the rest eight variables by loop and assign() function. This flexibility renders R an advantage concerning repetitive work.

```{r}
for (i in 1:9) {
  BVRT_i = paste0("BVRT_", i)
  IST_i = paste0("IST_", i)
  # create new variable name
  MEM_i = paste0("MEM_", i)
  # assign value to each new variable
  wide_paquid = wide_paquid  %>% 
    rowwise("ID") %>% 
    mutate(!!sym(MEM_i) := mean(c(get(BVRT_i),get(IST_i)))) %>% 
    ungroup()
}
# sym(new_col_name) := is a dynamic way of writing MEM_1 = , MEM_2 = ,etc 
# when using functions like mutate()
# in the tidyr package

```

---

# Row-wise calculation

9.View variables that contain “MEM”, “BVRT”, or “IST”.:

```{r}
wide_paquid %>% 
  select(contains(c("ID", "MEM", "BVRT","IST"))) 

wide_paquid
```

---

# Summarizing data

10.Summarize variable “age_init” (mean, sd, quantiles, etc), summarize “age_init” by variable “male”.

* As is shown before, we can use `summary` function.

```{r}
summary(wide_paquid$age_init)
# sd is missing, we can calculate it with sd() function
sd(wide_paquid$age_init)
```

---

# Summarizing data
* If we would like to summary by a specific group: Use `group_by` function and `summarise` function, connected by pipeline:

```{r}
wide_paquid %>% 
  group_by(male) %>% 
  summarise(max = max(age_init),
            q3 = quantile(age_init, 0.75),
            mean = mean(age_init),
            q1 = quantile(age_init, 0.25),
            min = min(age_init),
            sd = sd(age_init)
            )

```

---

# Summarizing data

11.Summarize variable “MMSE_1” (mean, sd, quantiles, etc), summarize “age_init” by variable “male”. Note how R deals with missing values.

--

This question is similar to the previous one. I would leave it to the audience.

---

# Summarizing data

12.Tabulate variable “male”, tabulate variable “male” and “education”, add row-wise and column-wise proportions.

* Find frequency of elements in male

```{r}
table(wide_paquid$male)
```

--

* Male and education
```{r}
tab_male_edu = table(wide_paquid %>% select("male", "education"))
prop.table(tab_male_edu)
```

---

# Summarizing data

* It seems difficult to add column to table() directly, so we convert it to tibble first

```{r}
tib_male_edu = as_tibble(table(wide_paquid %>% select("male", "education")))
tib_male_edu
```

---

# Summarizing data

* Add proportion column to the tibble:
```{r}
tib_male_edu$proportion = tib_male_edu$n / 500
tib_male_edu
```

---

# Summarizing data

13.Draw a histogram and a density plot of “MMSE_1”: Use `hist` and `plot` function:

```{r}
hist(wide_paquid$MMSE_1)
```

---

# Summarizing data

```{r}
plot(density(wide_paquid$MMSE_1,na.rm = T))
```

---

# Run simple models and check model output

14.Run a linear regression, with **“MMSE_1”** as **dependent** variable and **“age_init”** and **“male”** as the **independent** variables, assuming “MMSE_1” has a normal distribution. Check model output.

--

* Use `lm` function. --->R studio

```{r, results='hide'}
linear_m = lm(formula = MMSE_1 ~ age_init + male,data = wide_paquid)
```

---
# Run simple models and check model output

* Output from `summary` function:
```{r}
summary(linear_m)
```

---
# Run simple models and check model output

* Extract certain information from `summary` function:

```{r}
summary(linear_m)$coefficients
```

--

This output is super useful, when we have many combinations of dependent ~ independent. For example:

* Assuming we have 12 air pollution variables & 10 MRI variables. There are 120 pairs in total.
* We want to find which air pollutants could be significant in linear regression with MRI. Controlling for age, education, gender, etc...

--

* A loop can easily solve this problem! (Code script is available if anyone needs.)

---

# Run simple models and check model output

* Check the residual for model evaluation: ---> R studio

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# residuals
linear_m$residuals
plot(linear_m)
```

---

# Run simple models and check model output

15.Run a logistic regression, with “dem_young” as dependent variable and “male” as the independent variables.

* Use `glm` function, set family = binomial. It is similar to `lm` function.

```{r}
logi_m = glm(formula = dem_young ~ male,data = wide_paquid, family = "binomial")
logi_m
```

---

# Run simple models and check model output

```{r, results='hide'}
# output
summary(logi_m)
summary(logi_m)$coefficients
# similar to lm function's output

# residuals
logi_m$residuals

# fitted values
fitted.values(logi_m)

```

---

# Run simple models and check model output

* For binary estimation, we are usually interested in the predicted probability for each observation and the overall prediction accuracy.

$$ \text{accuracy} = \frac{ \text{Number of correct prediction} }{ \text{Number of ovservation}}$$

```{r}
# probability
probabilities  = predict(logi_m,type = "response")
probabilities[1:5]

# overall accuracy, assume threshold = 0.5
predicted.classes <- ifelse(probabilities > 0.5, 1, 0)
mean(predicted.classes == wide_paquid$dem_young)
```

# Ending

* At first you may feel difficult. But don't worry, R has a strong user community, basically you can solve most of the problems by Google. 

--

* After using R several years, I still rely heavily on Google and I keep learning new things. 

--

* Because of its strong community, R now has many extensions. For example, this whole slide is written by R...

--

* R code for all the exercises is available on my github page: https://github.com/Bolin-Wu/Rworkshop_KI. If you have any question please feel free to ask and we can discuss together!
